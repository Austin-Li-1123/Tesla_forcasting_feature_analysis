## Project ideas

Traditional stock prediction models + one feature (Elon Musk twitter frequency/)

## Dataset
Tesla closing price: This can be obtained from traditional sources such as Yahoo! Finance. 
Elon Musk twitter history:  https://ads-api.twitter.com/10/accounts/:account_id/account_history
SpaceX launch date/status: https://www.kaggle.com/rosetabares/spacemissionsflightstatus

## Research Question
How do external factors affect the performance of traditional stock forecasting models?
Elon Musk twitter -> Tesla stock price
SpaceX Launch failure -> Tesla stock price
Competitors (Nio/BYD) -> Tesla stock price (optional)


## Why is this project worth investing in?
This project is an attempt to make existing forecasting models more robust which directly generates revenue for investment banks and hedge funds. Tesla stock is often topical and has significant trading volume and it is worth studying. 

In the modern quantitative research industry, innovation and use of previously neglected data sources are what push the industry forward. Here in this project we investigate the influence of external factors as additional features to traditional forecasting models, comparing the performance of any combination of them as well. For instance, we will operate the sentiment analysis of Elon Musk’s Twitter to see if it fluctuates the Tesla’s closing price. Also, we will explore how SpaceX (Elon Musk’s other company)’s launch failures affect the Tesla stock price. State of the art forecasting techniques such as recurrent networks and deep learning are referenced and modified in this project so that it is technically relevant in 2021.

This project focuses on the level of influence external data has, as an effort to expand the current research done in the quantitative field in this specific area. Therefore, datasets that are remotely connected to the topic but are not direct financial datasets are selected here.

## Why do we think we are likely to succeed?
There are sufficient datasets on at least two of the external data sources that we identified, providing plentiful room of investigation on their influences. Additionally, stock opening and closing prices are readily available on Yahoo! Finance. As for previously done work, there is plenty of literature for review as well as pre-trained models to reduce some heavy-lifting of this project.
